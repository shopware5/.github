# Shopware 5 repositories

## General information

This community-driven, noncommercial project contains all repositories related to Shopware 5.
The core itself, multiple extensions, documentation, and other tooling.<br>
This community-driven project is not a project of `shopware AG`, which previously marketed Shopware 5 as a community edition or as a commercial version.
However, `shopware AG` has allowed us as developers to start this project as separate and community-driven.
